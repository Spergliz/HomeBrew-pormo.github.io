    <p style="text-align:center;">Homebrew is very epic. Nintendo does not like Nintendo due to being able to pirate games while that is fair.<br>
        BUT<br>
nintendo has also made the switch have borderline no personality. consoles like the 3DS, the wii, the wiiu etc, can be customized and have a fun personality.<br>
Which is part of the reason i have advocated for modding and hacking switches and other game consoles.<br>
Homebrew is one of the reason we have access to some games that are exclusive to other regions such as mother 3, <br>
a well known RPG that nintendo has yet to translate to the english language. <br> 
Due to nintendo's incompetence and just plain ignorance they have not made a english port, <br>
so instead of nintendo doing it, fans and hacker have ported it to english. Showing that hackers and random people have more dedication than nintendo themeselves. <br>
